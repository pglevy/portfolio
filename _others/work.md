Other tinkering Iâ€™ve done at work:
* [Mindful Meeting Invitation](https://pglevy.github.io/mindful-meeting-invitation/): To keep things from getting crazy at work, I created a template for Outlook and other calendar apps for encouraging good meeting invitation etiquette.
* [Plain Vanilla GitHub Pages](https://pglevy.github.io/plain-vanilla-gh-pages/): To make it as easy as possible for less-technical people like me to create basic websites for free on GitHub Pages, I set up this repository template with instructions.
* [Social Security Administration Design Challenge](https://bixal.invisionapp.com/board/SSA-Design-Challenge-ckdze9hzx019e0zytq3u0qztq): As part of the bidding process for work we won with SSA, we participated in a two-day design challenge to demonstrate a sampling of our process.
