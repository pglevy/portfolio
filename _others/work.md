Other tinkering I've done at work:
* [Mindful Meeting Invitation](https://pglevy.github.io/mindful-meeting-invitation/): To keep things from getting crazy at work, I created a template for Outlook and other calendar apps for encouraging good meeting invitation etiquette.
* [USWDS Component Codepen](https://codepen.io/pglevy/pen/oNjBBow): When contributing to a new component for the U.S. Web Design System, instead of creating mockups in a UI tool, I went right to code to explore different approaches.
* [Automatic check-ins in MS Teams](https://www.evernote.com/l/ACTel-i1zJVIW4PIr9khNw-TqzBxmUVpOxA): Since we don't have Basecamp at work, I used Microsoft's automation tools to create a similar experience for automatic check-ins in Teams.
* [Social Security Administration Design Challenge](https://bixal.invisionapp.com/board/SSA-Design-Challenge-ckdze9hzx019e0zytq3u0qztq): As part of the procurement process for work we won with SSA, we participated in a two-day design challenge to demonstrate a sampling of our process.
