## Other tinkering I’ve done at work

* <span class="badge badge-secondary">New</span> [Tweetto Burrito](https://pglevy.github.io/tweetto-burrito/): Generate “call-to-tweet” links for your email newsletters and websites to make it super-simple for your audience to shout you out on Twitter — [like this](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=Thanks%20%40pglevy%20for%20this%20cool%20%E2%80%9Ccall-to-tweet-action%E2%80%9D%20link%20generator.%20Check%20it%20out%20here%3A%20&url=https%3A%2F%2Fpglevy.github.io%2Ftweetto-burrito%2F&hashtags=)!
* [No-Code API with GitHub Pages](https://github.com/githubfornocoders/nocode-api-github-pages): With the goal of making it as easy as possible to turn a CSV file into a free, read-only API without touching any code, I created this project that only requires 3 simple steps: clone the template, replace the data file, and turn on GitHub Pages.
* [Markdown Flows](https://codepen.io/pglevy/pen/PoKzjZR): Inspired by Laurent Baumann’s [uxmd](https://github.com/lobau/uxmd), I built a tool for creating simple user interaction flows using Markdown and some very basic JavaScript leveraging the Codepen web-based, social coding platform.
* [Plain Vanilla GitHub Pages](https://pglevy.github.io/plain-vanilla-gh-pages/): To make it as easy as possible for less-technical people like me to create basic websites for free on GitHub Pages, I set up this repository template with instructions.
