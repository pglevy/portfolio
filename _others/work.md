## Other tinkering I’ve done at work
{: .h4}

* [No-Code API with GitHub Pages](https://github.com/githubfornocoders/nocode-api-github-pages): With the goal of making it as easy as possible to turn a CSV file into a free, read-only API without touching any code, I created this project that only requires 3 simple steps: clone the template, paste over the data file, and turn on GitHub Pages.
* [Markdown Flows](https://codepen.io/pglevy/pen/PoKzjZR): Inspired by Laurent Baumann’s [uxmd](https://github.com/lobau/uxmd), I built a tool for creating simple user interaction flows using Markdown and some very basic JavaScript leveraging the Codepen web-based, social coding platform.
* [Plain Vanilla GitHub Pages](https://pglevy.github.io/plain-vanilla-gh-pages/): To make it as easy as possible for less-technical people like me to create basic websites for free on GitHub Pages, I set up this repository template with instructions.
