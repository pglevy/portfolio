## Me
I started my educational journey in music production and engineering and wound my way through web development and instructional design before discovering user experience and product design.

Currently, I'm a Lead UX Designer at [Appian](https://appian.com/), a leader in low-code development and process automation, focusing on improving the low-code developer experience and lowering the barriers to process mining.

I think it's important for designers to learn about the history of our practice, so I started a podcast called [Designer Sketches](https://designersketches.substack.com/) to profile the lives and work of influential designers of the past century.

Aside from design, these are some other topics Iâ€™m interested in:

* Investing: learning about financial history, how companies innovate and provide value, and how I can contribute and benefit as a long-term shareholder.
* Meditation and yoga: practicing mindfulness and creating good habits around both physical and mental health.
* Decluttering: looking for ways to reduce stress and simply life by removing unnecessary things from physical and digital spaces, as well as reducing repetitive actions through automation.
* Great Books: learning more about the human condition through reading and contemplating the foundational works of Western Civilization.
