## Me
I believe in the power of design thinking and doing as a positive force for the healthy growth and continuous improvement of mission-driven organizations.

I started my educational journey in music production and engineering and wound my way through web development and instructional design before discovering experience and product design.

I’m interested in all things that involve value creation and exchange, from a personal level all the way up through teams, organizations, and communities.

Other topics I’m interested in:

* Investing: learning about financial history, how companies innovate and provide value, and how I can contribute and benefit as a long-term shareholder.
* Meditation and yoga: practicing mindfulness and creating good habits around both physical and mental health.
* Decluttering: looking for ways to reduce stress and simply life by removing unnecessary things from physical and digital spaces, as well as reducing repetitive actions through automation.
