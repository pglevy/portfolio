## About me
I believe in the power of design thinking and doing as a positive force for the healthy growth and continuous improvement of mission-driven organizations.

I started my educational journey in music production and engineering and wound my way through web development and instructional design before discovering experience and product design.

Iâ€™m interested in all things that involve value creation and exchange, from a personal level all the way up through teams, organizations, and communities.
