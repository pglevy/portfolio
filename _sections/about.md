## Me
I started my educational journey in music production and engineering and wound my way through web development and instructional design before discovering user experience and product design.

Currently, I'm a Lead UX Designer at [Appian](https://appian.com/), a leader in low-code development and process automation, focusing on improving the low-code developer experience and lowering the barriers to process mining.

I'm an AI-optimist, and I'm excited about the future potential of working alongside AI agents. I also think it's important for designers to learn about the history of our practice, so I started a podcast called [Designer Sketches](https://designersketches.substack.com/) to profile the lives and work of influential designers of the past century. (Though it has been languishing a bit as I've been focused on making stuff with AI for both work and side projects.)
