### _@Home_: Chief Entrepreneurship Officer
{: .mt-4}

Our family of four runs a modified version of “startup and experiment cycles,” inspired by [_Shape Up_](https://basecamp.com/shapeup/), to encourage an entrepreneurial mindset and practice at home. These are some of our projects over the past year. All of these sites (except for the e-commerce one) are built with Jekyll in public repos on [GitHub](https://github.com/pglevy).
