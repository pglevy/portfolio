Basic intro of who I am:

## Work

### Employee Experience Designer _@Work_
Lead a team of experience designers and researchers at Bixal where we're using human-centered design and agile mindsets to improve the customer experience of the federal government.

#### [Practice charter](https://bixal.github.io/uxd-practice-charter/)
Articulation of how we work, includes a lot of my thinking.

#### [Methods toolkit](https://bixal.github.io/methods/)
Internal product based on 18F original, tools and resources for our practice.

#### [UX Team Handbook](https://bixal.github.io/bixal-uxd-team-handbook/)
Handbook for my team, inspired by Basecamp Handbook.

Other tinkering and design I've done at work:
* [Mindful Meeting Invitation](https://pglevy.github.io/mindful-meeting-invitation/): A template for Outlook and other calendar clients for encouraging good meeting invitation etiquette.
* [USWDS Component Codepen](https://codepen.io/pglevy/pen/oNjBBow): When contributing to a new component for the U.S. Web Design System, instead of creating mockup in a UI tool, I went right to code to explore different approaches.
* [Automatic check-ins in MS Teams](https://www.evernote.com/l/ACTel-i1zJVIW4PIr9khNw-TqzBxmUVpOxA): Since we can't use Basecamp at work, I used Microsoft's automation tools to create a similar experience in Teams.
* [Social Security Administration Design Challenge](https://bixal.invisionapp.com/board/SSA-Design-Challenge-ckdze9hzx019e0zytq3u0qztq): As part of the procurement for work we won with SSA, we participated in a two-day challenge to demonstrate a sampling of our process.

### Chief Entrepreneurship Officer _@Home_
Our family of four runs a version of cycles, inspired by Shape Up, to encourage an entrepreneurial mindset and practice. These are some of our projects over the past year.

#### [Money Moves for Teens Podcast](https://moneymovesforteens.com/)
During quarantine, my daughter launched a podcast focused on financial health for her fellow teens, and she's already released almost two dozen episodes.

#### [Sophia Music Studio](https://sophiamusicstudio.com/)
My wife has taught voice and piano for many years, but she became bored with the repetitive nature of ongoing lessons, so we reimagined her business as a project-based service.

A few other startups we've experimented with:
* [Talia's Tutoring](https://taliastutoring.com/): my daughter's math tutoring service.
* [Frac/tion Clothing](https://teespring.com/stores/fraction): my son's clothing and lifestyle brand.
* [Budget Booster](https://budgetboosterfinancialcoaching.weebly.com/): a concept for personal budget coaching service.

(<a href="https://twitter.com/moneymoves14s?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@moneymoves14s</a>) At 14, I was probably dropping firecrackers in a sewer. I feel like that&#39;s generational progress.</p>&mdash; Philip Levy (@pglevy) <a href="https://twitter.com/pglevy/status/1311697386012467200?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 1, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

## About me

Other things I'm interested in:
* Investing: learning about financial history, how companies innovate and provide value, and how I can contribute and benefit as a long-term shareholder.
* Meditation and yoga: practicing mindfulness and creating good habits around both physical and mental health.
* Decluttering: looking for ways to reduce stress and simply life by removing unnecessary things from physical and digital spaces, as well as removing unnecessary activities through automation.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Big data is a fancy way to say &quot;digital clutter.&quot; The reason it has more value than our extra storage spaces full of physical clutter is that it&#39;s readily accessible to machines that can analyze it for the purpose of selling us more stuff.</p>&mdash; Philip Levy (@pglevy) <a href="https://twitter.com/pglevy/status/1308798284950056967?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 23, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
