# Hi! I'm Philip. Welcome to my portfolio.
My passion is the practice of design, for everything from processes to products. I love engaging with people to dream up and make things that create mutual value and benefits.

## My Work
Here are some examples of my recent work. It's split between things I do with my colleagues at work and things I do with my family at home, where I play different but complementary roles.

### _@Work_: Employee Experience Designer
I lead a team of seven experience designers and researchers at [Bixal](https://www.bixal.com/) where we're using human-centered design and agile mindsets and methods to improve the customer experience of the federal government.

### _@Home_: Chief Entrepreneurship Officer
Our family of four runs a modified version of "startup and experiment cycles," inspired by [_Shape Up_](https://basecamp.com/shapeup/), to encourage an entrepreneurial mindset and practice. These are some of our projects over the past year.

## About me
I believe in the power of design thinking and doing as a positive force for the healthy growth and continuous improvement of mission-driven organizations.

I started my educational journey in music production and engineering and wound my way through web development and instructional design before discovering experience and product design.

I'm interested in all things that involve value creation and exchange, from a personal level all the way up through teams, organizations, and communities.
