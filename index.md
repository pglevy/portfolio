# Hi! I'm Philip. Welcome to my portfolio.
My passion is the practice of design, for everything from processes to products. I love engaging with people to dream up and make things that create mutual value and benefits.

## My Work
Here are some examples of my recent work. It's split between things I do with my colleagues at work and things I do with my family at home, where I play different but complementary roles.

### _@Work_: Employee Experience Designer
I lead a team of seven experience designers and researchers at [Bixal](https://www.bixal.com/) where we're using human-centered design and agile mindsets and methods to improve the customer experience of the federal government.

Other tinkering I've done at work:
* [Mindful Meeting Invitation](https://pglevy.github.io/mindful-meeting-invitation/): To keep things from getting crazy at work, I created a template for Outlook and other calendar apps for encouraging good meeting invitation etiquette.
* [USWDS Component Codepen](https://codepen.io/pglevy/pen/oNjBBow): When contributing to a new component for the U.S. Web Design System, instead of creating mockups in a UI tool, I went right to code to explore different approaches.
* [Automatic check-ins in MS Teams](https://www.evernote.com/l/ACTel-i1zJVIW4PIr9khNw-TqzBxmUVpOxA): Since we don't have Basecamp at work, I used Microsoft's automation tools to create a similar experience for automatic check-ins in Teams.
* [Social Security Administration Design Challenge](https://bixal.invisionapp.com/board/SSA-Design-Challenge-ckdze9hzx019e0zytq3u0qztq): As part of the procurement process for work we won with SSA, we participated in a two-day design challenge to demonstrate a sampling of our process.

### _@Home_: Chief Entrepreneurship Officer
Our family of four runs a modified version of "startup and experiment cycles," inspired by [_Shape Up_](https://basecamp.com/shapeup/), to encourage an entrepreneurial mindset and practice. These are some of our projects over the past year.

#### [Money Moves for Teens Podcast](https://moneymovesforteens.com/)
During quarantine, my daughter launched a podcast focused on financial health for her fellow teens, and she's already released almost two dozen episodes.

#### [Sophia Music Studio](https://sophiamusicstudio.com/)
My wife has taught voice and piano for many years, but she became bored with the repetitive nature of ongoing lessons, so we reimagined her business as a project-based service.

Other startups and experiments we've run:
* [Talia's Tutoring](https://taliastutoring.com/): my daughter's math tutoring service.
* [Frac/tion Clothing](https://teespring.com/stores/fraction): my son's clothing and lifestyle brand.
* [Budget Booster](https://budgetboosterfinancialcoaching.weebly.com/): a concept for a personal budget coaching service.

I feel like that&#39;s generational progress.</p>&mdash; Philip Levy (@pglevy) <a href="https://twitter.com/pglevy/status/1311697386012467200?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 1, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

## About me
I believe in the power of design thinking and doing as a positive force for the healthy growth and continuous improvement of mission-driven organizations.

I started my educational journey in music production and engineering and wound my way through web development and instructional design before discovering experience and product design.

I'm interested in all things that involve value creation and exchange, from a personal level all the way up through teams, organizations, and communities.

Other topics I'm interested in:
* **Investing**: learning about financial history, how companies innovate and provide value, and how I can contribute and benefit as a long-term shareholder.
* **Meditation and yoga**: practicing mindfulness and creating good habits around both physical and mental health.
* **Decluttering**: looking for ways to reduce stress and simply life by removing unnecessary things from physical and digital spaces, as well as removing unnecessary activities through automation.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Big data is a fancy way to say &quot;digital clutter.&quot; The reason it has more value than our extra storage spaces full of physical clutter is that it&#39;s readily accessible to machines that can analyze it for the purpose of selling us more stuff.</p>&mdash; Philip Levy (@pglevy) <a href="https://twitter.com/pglevy/status/1308798284950056967?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 23, 2020</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
